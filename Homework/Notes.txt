The game Rock/Paper/Scissors has the following rules:

Scissors always wins against Paper
Rock always wins against Scissors
Paper always wins against Rock
Create the following three classes that follow these rules:

PlayerRock – Always performs the Act() of Rock.
PlayerScissors – Always performs the Act() of Scissors.
PlayerPaper – Always performs the Act() of Paper.
Create a Game class that has a method named Fight() that satisifies these requirements:

The Fight() method accepts two parameters:  Player1 and Player2.
The Fight() method calls both player's Act() methods.
The Fight() method returns the winning player using the Rock/Paper/Scissors rules above.
After 100 rounds, which player wins?


1.  Loop through the game 100 times - no input??
2.  The act of Rock: if rock & paper win = false; if rock & scissors, win = true; return win
3.  The act of Paper: if paper & rock win = true; if paper & scissors, win = false; return win
4.  The act of Scissors: if scissors & rock win = false; if scissors & paper win = true; return win
5.  Game Class:
	5a.  Fight("player1", "player2", player1WinCount, player2WinCount)
			
			player1Rock = new PlayerRock(player2)

			PlayerRock(player1, player2)				
			PlayerPaper(player1, player2)
			PlayerScissors(player1, player2)
			
6.  PlayerRock Class 
		Constructor()
		Act(otherWeapon)
			if (otherWeapon == "scissors")
			{
				bool win = true;
			}
			else
			{
				bool win = false;
			}

7.  PlayerPaper Class 
		Constructor()
		Act(otherWeapon)
			if (otherWeapon == "rock")
			{
				bool win = true;
			}
			else
			{
				bool win = false;
			}
	
8.  PlayerScissors Class 
		Constructor()
		Act(otherWeapon)
			if (otherWeapon == "paper")
			{
				bool win = true;
			}
			else
